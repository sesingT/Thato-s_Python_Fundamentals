# Day 5

#Try This Variation
#Store your name in a variable and print it.

name = "Titos"
print(name)

#Thinking Challenges
#🟢 Easy: What will this print?
#x = 10
#print(x)
#print(x + 5)

#Output : 5 + 10 = 15

x = 10
print(x)
print(x + 5)

#🟡 Medium: Fix this code:
#name = "Alex
#age = 25
#print(name)
#print age

name = "Alex"
age = 25
print(name)
print(age)

#🔴 Hard: Create a program using variables:
# Store your birth year in a variable
# Store current year (2025) in a variable
# Calculate and print your age
# Print a sentence like "I am X years old"

birth_year = 1888
current_year = 2025
age = current_year-birth_year
print(age)
print("I am" ,age, "years old")

#🧩 Days 1-5 Consolidation Exercises
#Exercise 1 — Fill in the Blanks
# Store the number 100 in a variable called 'score'
#_____ = _____

score=100

# Print the score
#print(_____)

print (score)

# Calculate and print score plus 50
#print(score _____ 50)

print(score + 50)


#Constraint: Write from scratch. No copy-paste from earlier code.
#Exercise 2 — Build from Scratch
#Create a program that:
#Stores your name in a variable
#Stores your age in a variable
#Stores your favorite number in a variable
#Prints all three with labels (e.g., "Name: Alex")
#Calculates and prints: age + favorite number
#Constraint: Write from scratch. No copy-paste.

name = "T"
age =  50
f_no = 8
print("Name:",name, ",Age:",age, ",Favourite number:",f_no,)
print(age+f_no)



x = 2
if x == 3:
    print('same values')
else:
    print("wrong")

x = 2
if x == 2:
    print("same values")
else:
    print("wrong")

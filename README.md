# Thato-s_Python_Fundamentals

My Python learning journey.

This repository is where I am learning Python step by step, starting from the very basics.
I am focusing on understanding how things work instead of rushing or copying solutions.

The code here includes:
- Printing and basic syntax
- Variables and calculations
- Strings, slicing, and formatting (f-strings)
- Small challenges and experiments
- Mistakes, fixes, and retries
- Capstone project to test my knowledge and more

Some code may look simple or messy but that is intentional.
This repo shows my progress as I learn, struggle, fix errors, and improve over time.

I am using this to build a strong foundation before moving into more advanced topics like
logic, user input, and real projects.

This is part of my journey into programming and software development.
